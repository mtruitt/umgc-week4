# GUI &amp; Recursion
### UMGC CMIS 242

Research different widgets that are included in this Java swing package.
Post a short description of one widget that you selected to write a program for. Some widgets include JCheckBox, JRadioButton, JLabel, JMenu, JComboBox, JList, JPasswordField, JTable, JTextField, JColorChooser, etc.

Select a widget that another student has not chosen yet or one that has enough functionality where you can add to the description and have a different program. For example, many widgets can have an event handler and your program can do different actions for an event.

Create a Java program that creates a GUI using JFrame and JPanel and adds your selected widget. Make sure you check out the example programs in this week's materials first. 

Create a small code example to demonstrate the execution of the recursion feature.
